Becomes mandatory to restart the phone.- If a call comes, and you are unable to pick the call, it keeps ringing even if the call has ended from the opposite end.- Truecaller app has conflicts with the Phone dialer.- Dual-apps have issues, WhatsApp, Truecaller etc.- Apps like Udemy, YouTube get stuck, maybe due to the video player codec issues.- Last call records get deleted automatically.- NO 5G support for my Airtel and Jio sims!It was running OS 11, I updated it with the latest available 12 and MiUi versions as well but still no help.",NEGATIVE

Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example.

Its camera quality is very bad, 50MP is only a tag, the pixels breaks at even 1X zoom, front camera quality is also bad. The display quality is also low, when going outside in sunny day light, the display colors softens and lowers the color strength of display (totally bad experience). The sound quality is also not as good as compared to other phones available in the market. Don't waste your money on realme.Overall experience is don't buy this phone in this budget, lot of other phones are available in the market/amazon, don't waste your money on buying narzo 50.50 MP camera is only a tag, i Can't give the 1 rating out of 10 to the display and camera quality of this phone..

The battery still holds up fine even with an interactive wallpaper (fluid simulation with touch and audio)on my home screen. The extented ram function has kept apps crashing quite well, it does heat up on resources hungry apps but still manage to keep multiple apps running (discord, game app and screen capture/ streaming). There are some bloatware but can be easily disabled or restricted. Never got it for the camera but nevertheless it's decent, the assistant apps are very responsive so had to disable them from constantly listening. You may have to personalize the settings a bit and give it a few days to get used to but after that it's golden I'd say.The only drawback is that the accessories, it was hard getting a decent screen guard or case mostly because there was a very small pool to select from when searching with the phone model number or name. I had to get them with previous releases(diffrent model number/name) that fit the same dimensions and design of the phone.",NEGATIVE

Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example.

Becomes mandatory to restart the phone.- If a call comes, and you are unable to pick the call, it keeps ringing even if the call has ended from the opposite end.- Truecaller app has conflicts with the Phone dialer.- Dual-apps have issues, WhatsApp, Truecaller etc.- Apps like Udemy, YouTube get stuck, maybe due to the video player codec issues.- Last call records get deleted automatically.- NO 5G support for my Airtel and Jio sims!It was running OS 11, I updated it with the latest available 12 and MiUi versions as well but still no help.",NEGATIVE

30,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,4.0,"Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger",null

Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example. Quality may be little compressed while transferring from M32 to this M21 through Whatsapp.",POSITIVE

39,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,4.0,"Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger",null

I am also using a Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB- 128GB phone. So can tell some pros and some cons of this M32 when compared to M21.Display is almost exact the same. Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example. Quality may be little compressed while transferring from M32 to this M21 through Whatsapp.",POSITIVE

It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2.

60,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,1.0,"Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger",null

There are some bloatware but can be easily disabled or restricted. Never got it for the camera but nevertheless it's decent, the assistant apps are very responsive so had to disable them from constantly listening. You may have to personalize the settings a bit and give it a few days to get used to but after that it's golden I'd say.The only drawback is that the accessories, it was hard getting a decent screen guard or case mostly because there was a very small pool to select from when searching with the phone model number or name. I had to get them with previous releases(diffrent model number/name) that fit the same dimensions and design of the phone.",NEGATIVE

65,Priyank ,Reviewed in India on 13 October 2022,4.0,"I read many comments regarding the heating issue. I also faced the same problem and I got the reason for this. This phone have a feature of RAM extension which uses the swap memory(Which means it uses internal memory as ram if the physical RAM is full) also the speed of internal memory is not equal to physical RAM, so when you use multiple apps, its start using internal memory as a RAM which is not able to handle app switching as physical RAM can do and start struggle, which leads to starting heat. This is my first phone with an inbuilt memory extension feature but I already use this feature in old android by rooting methods when RAM was only 256 or 512 MB.  So don't use the memory extension feature, As per my knowledge, there is no solution even from the software side to resolve it, in today's market companies only make fool us by introducing this type of foolish feature. Just turn off the memory extension feature and if you need more RAM, Go to a higher version, upvote my comment if you read till end and if you find it useful.",NEGATIVE

It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.,POSITIVE

But the core issue with this phone is the network issues, this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently. Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength, signal quality and signal type. I have tried Jio, Airtel &amp; Vodafone in the last 9 months, all with similar issues but especially so with Jio. Being a phone, if it can't make calls reliably it's an abject failure.

79,Priyank ,Reviewed in India on 13 October 2022,1.0,"I read many comments regarding the heating issue. I also faced the same problem and I got the reason for this. This phone have a feature of RAM extension which uses the swap memory(Which means it uses internal memory as ram if the physical RAM is full) also the speed of internal memory is not equal to physical RAM, so when you use multiple apps, its start using internal memory as a RAM which is not able to handle app switching as physical RAM can do and start struggle, which leads to starting heat. This is my first phone with an inbuilt memory extension feature but I already use this feature in old android by rooting methods when RAM was only 256 or 512 MB.  So don't use the memory extension feature, As per my knowledge, there is no solution even from the software side to resolve it, in today's market companies only make fool us by introducing this type of foolish feature. Just turn off the memory extension feature and if you need more RAM, Go to a higher version, upvote my comment if you read till end and if you find it useful.",NEGATIVE

I didn't notice any major difference in the pics I captured. Finger print scanner sometimes need reapeated tries. One major glitche is many times the display goes to sleep mode when I play voice messages in WhatsApp. Many users who are facing this problem says it a proximity sensor issue.Even the speed is almost equal to my note 5 proDon't know if all these problems are hardware or software glitches.Long story short, I still plan to use it as long as I am able to make calls.
