0,Achintya,"Reviewed in India on September 20, 2022",4.0,This is my third redmi phone and probably the last one. The main issue is its compass sensor is not working and you can't use it for Navigation/Google maps. Whenever I open google maps app the screen keeps on rotating. After careful analysis I found out that compass sensor is not working.<br>Also it is very heavy phone(209 grams) and your wrists will pain if you use it for long time.

I had to put my phone on speaker to attend calls. This happened in first 6 months itself .<br><br>Now since few months I get auto-restart problem . the phone goes to non stop boot loop. It is a issue with MIUI. I tried factory reset multiple times and yet the issue occurs again and again .<br><br>I had samsung before this and that as well touch was lost two times in 1 year. I am loosing faith in android phones slowly.

So, news clips, media clips, or even FB on browser will also fail.<br>- Volume controls go haywire and volume becomes low if a call comes. Becomes mandatory to restart the phone.<br>- If a call comes, and you are unable to pick the call, it keeps ringing even if the call has ended from the opposite end.<br>- Truecaller app has conflicts with the Phone dialer.<br>- Dual-apps have issues, WhatsApp, Truecaller etc.<br>- Apps like Udemy, YouTube get stuck, maybe due to the video player codec issues.<br>- Last call records get deleted automatically.<br>- NO 5G support for my Airtel and Jio sims!<br><br>It was running OS 11, I updated it with the latest available 12 and MiUi versions as well but still no help."

But after completion of your warranty display is getting damaged without a single scratch on phone.<br>Mine display is got damaged green line appearing after OS 12 update. Do research on internet many other OP devices are damaged post this update. Quality of Hardware is very poor compare to price which we pay. Dont go on YouTube review they are payed one. Do search for display issue of One plus on internet or one plus community you will find many customers like me. I have done my job now it's your decision.

I am also using a Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB- 128GB phone. So can tell some pros and some cons of this M32 when compared to M21.<br>Display is almost exact the same. Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.<br>Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.<br>Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example. Quality may be little compressed while transferring from M32 to this M21 through Whatsapp."

Its camera quality is very bad, 50MP is only a tag, the pixels breaks at even 1X zoom, front camera quality is also bad. The display quality is also low, when going outside in sunny day light, the display colors softens and lowers the color strength of display (totally bad experience). The sound quality is also not as good as compared to other phones available in the market. Don't waste your money on realme.<br><br>Overall experience is don't buy this phone in this budget, lot of other phones are available in the market/amazon, don't waste your money on buying narzo 50.<br>50 MP camera is only a tag, i Can't give the 1 rating out of 10 to the display and camera quality of this phone..

21,Vikas J.,"Reviewed in India on October 15, 2022",1.0,"Been using the phone for a while now and it's yet to fail me so far. The battery still holds up fine even with an interactive wallpaper (fluid simulation with touch and audio)on my home screen. The extented ram function has kept apps crashing quite well, it does heat up on resources hungry apps but still manage to keep multiple apps running (discord, game app and screen capture/ streaming). There are some bloatware but can be easily disabled or restricted. Never got it for the camera but nevertheless it's decent, the assistant apps are very responsive so had to disable them from constantly listening. You may have to personalize the settings a bit and give it a few days to get used to but after that it's golden I'd say.<br>The only drawback is that the accessories, it was hard getting a decent screen guard or case mostly because there was a very small pool to select from when searching with the phone model number or name. I had to get them with previous releases(diffrent model number/name) that fit the same dimensions and design of the phone."

Becomes mandatory to restart the phone.<br>- If a call comes, and you are unable to pick the call, it keeps ringing even if the call has ended from the opposite end.<br>- Truecaller app has conflicts with the Phone dialer.<br>- Dual-apps have issues, WhatsApp, Truecaller etc.<br>- Apps like Udemy, YouTube get stuck, maybe due to the video player codec issues.<br>- Last call records get deleted automatically.<br>- NO 5G support for my Airtel and Jio sims!<br><br>It was running OS 11, I updated it with the latest available 12 and MiUi versions as well but still no help."

30,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,4.0,"Honest Review<br>I bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.<br>It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.<br><br>I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly.<br> Experience -<br>1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.<br>2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.<br>3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.<br><br>4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.<br>The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.<br>Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.<br>The voice focus function is good.<br>5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.<br>6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.<br>7. There are some really small good features<br>like samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.<br>8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.<br>9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.<br>The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.<br><br>Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.<br>No charger"

I am also using a Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB- 128GB phone. So can tell some pros and some cons of this M32 when compared to M21.<br>Display is almost exact the same. Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.<br>Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.<br>Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example. Quality may be little compressed while transferring from M32 to this M21 through Whatsapp."

39,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,4.0,"Honest Review<br>I bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.<br>It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.<br><br>I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly.<br> Experience -<br>1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.<br>2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.<br>3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.<br><br>4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.<br>The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.<br>Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.<br>The voice focus function is good.<br>5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.<br>6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.<br>7. There are some really small good features<br>like samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.<br>8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.<br>9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.<br>The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.<br><br>Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.<br>No charger"

Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.<br><br>Camera:<br>The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.<br><br>Finaly.<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Battery drains fast.<br>2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.<br>3. Little Heating problem.<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).<br>2. Powerful Processor.<br>3. Camera is super good.

Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.<br>now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model."
47,Ravi,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2022,4.0,"I bought this product and used it for 3 days, and within 3 days it started showing issues, especially with the screen. The screen kept flickering and then went completely blank. A technician visited but no success, and finally I had to go for a refund instead of a replacement because getting a replacement wouldn't help. I did my research and found so many videos and posts about this phone and they all reported almost the same issue. If you are reading this review, don't buy it."

I am also using a Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB- 128GB phone. So can tell some pros and some cons of this M32 when compared to M21.<br>Display is almost exact the same. Both phones screen mode in Natural, M21 feels with very little yellow while M32 feels somewhat blueish. But brightness is quite good for both the phones and display visible in direct sun.<br>Audio levels are same but I felt that M21 is more crisper during phone calls at maximum loudness. But this may be because M21 is more than one year old.<br>Both of these phones have decent camera setup and both of these capture good pics if used properly. M32 also has macro camera which takes good shots. I am attaching some shots captured with M32 for example. Quality may be little compressed while transferring from M32 to this M21 through Whatsapp."

But with every passing day thd prices of phones r skyrocketing but features and functionalities not up to mark.<br>3. Camera quality of M30 and M51 r far better than this one.<br>4. The biggest bummer... tried connecting my Bluetooth headset, but it's saying connect a wired headset. Question: who uses wired headsets these days? And if it's a prerequisite shouldn't samsung provide one??<br>5. Charging time is too long.<br>6. No model name displaye at start up.<br><br>Will keep on posting review"

Certain charging features may be unavailable."" Is this what a new phon3 should be doing? Just terrible experience with this. Plus the phone is stuck at 50% charges it's not charging further, and it also isn't getting discharged at all (it's not going lower than 50%) even after a couple of hours of use.

60,Dattaprasad Vaze,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,1.0,"Honest Review<br>I bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.<br>It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.<br><br>I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly.<br> Experience -<br>1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.<br>2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.<br>3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.<br><br>4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.<br>The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.<br>Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.<br>The voice focus function is good.<br>5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.<br>6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.<br>7. There are some really small good features<br>like samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.<br>8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.<br>9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.<br>The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.<br><br>Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.<br>No charger"

62,Manzoor-ul-Ahad,Reviewed in India on 16 October 2022,1.0,"I have purchased realme narzo 50 from Amazon amd after 6 months of its usage i didn't recommend you this phone at even 10K rupees. Its camera quality is very bad, 50MP is only a tag, the pixels breaks at even 1X zoom, front camera quality is also bad. The display quality is also low, when going outside in sunny day light, the display colors softens and lowers the color strength of display (totally bad experience). The sound quality is also not as good as compared to other phones available in the market. Don't waste your money on realme.<br><br>Overall experience is don't buy this phone in this budget, lot of other phones are available in the market/amazon, don't waste your money on buying narzo 50.<br>50 MP camera is only a tag, i Can't give the 1 rating out of 10 to the display and camera quality of this phone.. Biggest cheat from the realme manufacturer.."

62,Vikas J.,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,1.0,"Been using the phone for a while now and it's yet to fail me so far. The battery still holds up fine even with an interactive wallpaper (fluid simulation with touch and audio)on my home screen. The extented ram function has kept apps crashing quite well, it does heat up on resources hungry apps but still manage to keep multiple apps running (discord, game app and screen capture/ streaming). There are some bloatware but can be easily disabled or restricted. Never got it for the camera but nevertheless it's decent, the assistant apps are very responsive so had to disable them from constantly listening. You may have to personalize the settings a bit and give it a few days to get used to but after that it's golden I'd say.<br>The only drawback is that the accessories, it was hard getting a decent screen guard or case mostly because there was a very small pool to select from when searching with the phone model number or name. I had to get them with previous releases(diffrent model number/name) that fit the same dimensions and design of the phone."

It can also use as daily lifestyle mobile, coming to the battery performance right now for me it's perfect, Because I use this mobile as professional use.

65,Priyank ,Reviewed in India on 13 October 2022,4.0,"I read many comments regarding the heating issue. I also faced the same problem and I got the reason for this. This phone have a feature of RAM extension which uses the swap memory(Which means it uses internal memory as ram if the physical RAM is full) also the speed of internal memory is not equal to physical RAM, so when you use multiple apps, its start using internal memory as a RAM which is not able to handle app switching as physical RAM can do and start struggle, which leads to starting heat. This is my first phone with an inbuilt memory extension feature but I already use this feature in old android by rooting methods when RAM was only 256 or 512 MB.  So don't use the memory extension feature, As per my knowledge, there is no solution even from the software side to resolve it, in today's market companies only make fool us by introducing this type of foolish feature. Just turn off the memory extension feature and if you need more RAM, Go to a higher version, upvote my comment if you read till end and if you find it useful."

71,Utpal Swain,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,1.0,The phone is slim which makes it look attractive.<br>Samsung is the brand so the sensitivity and touch is descent.Expecting a fast sensitivity.No adapter so little to worry here as fast charge would support  or not so I am going with 25W adapter only.<br>Camera is not upto the mark when it talks about 108 MP. Samsung should provide enhancer built in with camera.<br>Budgeted phone overall.
71,Deva raju,Reviewed in India on 15 October 2022,1.0,"&nbsp;Giving this review after using 20 days.My usage is like-I don't play games ,I watch movies and using so many 3rd party apps.<br>Good things 1) Auto call recording without announcement 2) Big screen 3) Good performance 4) Good support from samsung 5) Battery performance (One full charge gave me around 30 hrs) and it took only 90 mins for complete charge 6) Samsung messages 7) Gorilla glass( It fall down but nothing happened) 7) Folder security<br>Bad things  1) No adapter 2) No back case 3)No  Ultra power save mode 4) No jack 5) Camera quality is ok but u get diff features.<br>Note: If you use other than samsung charger then it takes 2.30 hrs even though that's a 33w fast charger. So pay 1k extra and buy original 25w charger."

The screen is also decent and the cameras in the right lighting do take decent shots. But the core issue with this phone is the network issues, this phone just is not able to sustain any network consistently. Even phone networks that work flawlessly on other devices keep fluctuating with their signal strength, signal quality and signal type. I have tried Jio, Airtel &amp; Vodafone in the last 9 months, all with similar issues but especially so with Jio. Being a phone, if it can't make calls reliably it's an abject failure. So I would rate ZERO but doing the least I can at one."

It can also use as daily lifestyle mobile, coming to the battery performance right now for me it's perfect, Because I use this mobile as professional use.

79,Priyank ,Reviewed in India on 13 October 2022,1.0,"I read many comments regarding the heating issue. I also faced the same problem and I got the reason for this. This phone have a feature of RAM extension which uses the swap memory(Which means it uses internal memory as ram if the physical RAM is full) also the speed of internal memory is not equal to physical RAM, so when you use multiple apps, its start using internal memory as a RAM which is not able to handle app switching as physical RAM can do and start struggle, which leads to starting heat. This is my first phone with an inbuilt memory extension feature but I already use this feature in old android by rooting methods when RAM was only 256 or 512 MB.  So don't use the memory extension feature, As per my knowledge, there is no solution even from the software side to resolve it, in today's market companies only make fool us by introducing this type of foolish feature. Just turn off the memory extension feature and if you need more RAM, Go to a higher version, upvote my comment if you read till end and if you find it useful."

It's too good. i write this review after buying the first M52 5g 4 months back. now bought the 2nd M52 5g a few weeks backs.<br><br>I have used the phone extensively. not a day it hanged. very to robust and reliable. it needs proper handling. like good case and scratch guard. that way it is delicate.<br><br>Learn about the phone first watch some videos on YouTube. and then purchase. So you become familiar with the UI.<br><br>Thank you Samsung

Look and feel ok but not great compared to the price.<br>2. Previously, samsung phones within the range of 12-14k were worth it. But with every passing day thd prices of phones r skyrocketing but features and functionalities not up to mark.<br>3. Camera quality of M30 and M51 r far better than this one.<br>4. The biggest bummer... tried connecting my Bluetooth headset, but it's saying connect a wired headset. Question: who uses wired headsets these days? And if it's a prerequisite shouldn't samsung provide one??<br>5. Charging time is too long.<br>6. No model name displaye at start up.<br><br>Will keep on posting review"

Finger print scanner sometimes need reapeated tries. One major glitche is many times the display goes to sleep mode when I play voice messages in WhatsApp. Many users who are facing this problem says it a proximity sensor issue.<br>Even the speed is almost equal to my note 5 pro<br>Don't know if all these problems are hardware or software glitches.<br>Long story short, I still plan to use it as long as I am able to make calls.

91,Manoj Kumar Mukherjee,Reviewed in India on 9 October 2022,5.0,"Don't buy MI phones. MiUI update caused my front camera to stop working. Luckily my phone was in warranty. They changed the motherboard for free. Then in two months the motherboard went down again. Now my phone was out of warranty. They have a 3 month warranty on repaired parts. But when I claimed it, they came up with a policy of no warranty for parts that were already repaired during warranty. That is very strange indeed.<br><br>Basically once the phone is out of warranty it's a matter of time that they will come up with a faulty MiUI update which will damage ur phone. The customers are having to pay for company's poor quality updates."

The pictures in no way look like they have been clicked by a high resolution 108Mp camera. The same goes for the front camera &amp; the video quality.<br>Even a predecessor version of this mobile series, Redmi Note 7 Pro having just 48Mp camera gives so much better quality pics &amp; videos.<br>What about the battery life &amp; the rest of the features? Well, so far so good!<br>But you may have to reconsider your decision, in case you're going to buy this phone for its lucrative &amp; fancy looking camera."
93,karader,Reviewed in India on 13 October 2022,4.0,I am writing this review after use of 6months. This is avarage quality phone. Camera is not enough good it pretend 108MP.
